# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data.

## Overview
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago,
New York City, and Washington to answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 

## Program Details
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

Most popular month\
Most popular day\
Most popular hour\
Most popular start station\
Most popular end station\
Most popular combination of start and end stations\
Total trip duration\
Average trip duration\
Types of users by number\
Types of users by gender (if available)\
The oldest user (if available)\
The youngest user (if available)\
The most common birth year amongst users (if available)\
